# **Overview**

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Food production is one of the most significant contributors to environmental degradation, including issues such as climate change, water scarcity and biodiversity loss. The agricultural sector's environmental footprint varies widely across different food products, farming methods and geographical locations. Understanding the environmental impacts of food production is essential for developing more sustainable practices, reducing ecological footprints and making informed policy and consumer choices.

The goal of this project is to assess the environmental impact of food production at both macro and micro levels and propose data-driven insights to mitigate the negative effects of food production on the environment. This will help policy-makers, environmentalists, food producers and consumers make more informed decisions that support sustainability.

## **Crisp DM Framework**

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
The analyses followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following stages:

1.  **Business Understanding:**

    The objectives were defined below, followed by the formulation of analytic questions to guide the analysis:

    a\. Assess the environmental impact of food production: Analyse the environmental impact of these different food products based on key metrics such as water usage, land use, carbon emissions.

    b\. Compare food production methods: Evaluate how various farming techniques (plant based versus animal based) affect environmental sustainability.

    c\. Identify high-impact food products: Determine which foods contribute the most to environmental degradation and assess their sustainability

    d\. Provide data-driven insights: Develop actionable recommendations to reduce the footprint of food production, targeting policy-makers, food producers and consumers.

    e\. Promote sustainable food systems: Suggest strategies to transition toward more sustainable agricultural practices that minimise environmental harm.

    Analytic questions:

    I. What is the correlation between land use and carbon emissions for different food products?

    II\. How does eutrophication (nutrient run-off) vary among different types of food production?

    III\. How do plant-based and animal-based foods compare in terms of total carbon emissions per kg of product?

    IV\. Which food products have the highest total greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product?

    V. Which food products have the highest eutrophication potential (nutrient runoff) per kg of product?

    VI\.

    VII\. What are the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in food production and how can they be reduced?

    VIII\. What policy interventions (e.g., carbon taxes, incentives for sustainable farming) could help reduce the environmental footprint of food production?

2.  **Data Understanding:** The dataset contains most 43 most common foods grown across the globe and 23 columns as their respective land, water usage and carbon footprints. Variables include:

    a\. Land use change - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product

    b\. Animal Feed - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product

    c\. Farm - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product

    d\. Processing - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product

    e\. Transport - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product

    f\. Packaging - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product

    g\. Retail - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product

    These represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the life-cycle of food production.

3.  **Data Preparation**

    ```{r}
    # Load libraries
    library(janitor)
    library(dplyr)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(naniar)
    ```

    ```{r}
    # Read Food_Production.csv
    df <- read.csv("./00_raw_data/Food_Production.csv")
    ```

    ```{r}
    # Clean column names
    df <- df %>% clean_names()

    # Rename packging to packaging
    df <- df %>% rename(packaging = packging)
    ```

    ```{r}
    # Check the structure
    str(df) # The data looks structured

    # Check for duplicates
    sum(duplicated(df)) # No duplicates found
    ```

    ```{r}
    # Check for NA's 
    colSums(is.na(df))
    ```

    ```{r}
    # Visualising missing data
    # This shows the amount of missing data for each variable
    gg_miss_var(df)
    ```

    The bar chart displays the number of missing values for different variables in a dataset. The x-axis represents the number of missing values while the y-axis lists the variables.

    From the chart, the variables related to water use, land use, greenhouse gas emissions and eutrophying emissions per 100g protein or per 1000kcal have the most missing values, with some having close to 18 missing entries. On the other hand, variables related to food production stages such as transport, retail, processing, packaging, farm and animal feed no missing data.

    This suggests that the dataset is more complete for food production stages or processes but has gaps in environmental impact data, especially for nutrient-based metrics.

    To maintain data integrity and avoid biased imputations, the missing values are dropped.

    ```{r}
    # Remove missing values
    df <- na.omit(df)
    ```

4.  **Analysis and Visualisation**

    Summary Statistics

    ```{r}
    # Summary Statistics
    summary(df$total_emissions)
    ```

    The minimum total emission is 0.200 and the maximum total emission is 59.600.

    1St Quartile: 25% of the total emission falls under 0.850.

    3Rd Quartile: 25% of the total emission is above 6.000 or 75% of the total emission falls under 6.000.

    Skewness: The median (1.600) and mean(5.972) indicates, the distribution is skewed. The mean being greater than the median shows a positive skewness, that is, skewed to the right or right skewed.

    Exploratory Data Analysis

    A data visualisation of the top ten total emissions by food products

    ```{r message=F}
    # Group the data by the food product variable
    food_product_data <- df %>% 
      group_by(food_product) %>% 
      summarise(total_emissions = sum(total_emissions))

    # Limit to top ten
    food_product_data <- head(food_product_data, 10)

    # Visualise the data  
    ggplot(food_product_data, aes(x = food_product, y = total_emissions, fill = food_product)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
      labs(title = "Top Ten Total Emissions by Food Product", x = "Food Product", y
           = "Total Emissions (Kg CO2)") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
      scale_fill_discrete(name = "Food Product")
    ```

    1.  The bar chart shows the distribution of the top ten total emission by food products. The y-axis represents total emissions while the x-axis lists the different food products. Each food product is represented by a different colour in the legend on the right.

        From the chart, Beef (beef herd) has the highest emissions by a large margin followed by Beef (dairy herd) which also has significant emissions but much lower in comparison. The remaining food products have relatively small emissions in comparison to beef. Cane Sugar and Beet Sugar have slightly higher emissions than most of the other products apart from beef but they are still much lower overall.

        This suggests that beef production has a significantly higher environmental impact in terms of emissions compared to other food products.

        Beef production has a higher environmental impact than other food sources due to factors like land use for grazing and crop production, greenhouse gas emissions from cattle and water pollution from waste run-off, as well as deforestation from cattle ranching.

        As stated by the Beef Research Council, Beef production requires vast amounts of land, both for grazing cattle and for growing feed crops. Globally, a significant portion of agricultural land is used for livestock including cattle and a large area of rainforests is destroyed to create grazing land.

        Cattle are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is released during the digestive process of cattle and also from manure management. The production of feed crops for cattle also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.
